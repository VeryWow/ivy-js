# Setup

Ivy installer is used to create new application boilerplate and setup the project in no time!

### Usage

In your command line, write:
```
npm install -g ivy-cli 
```

for npm, or
```
yarn global add ivy-cli
```

for yarn, in order to setup the ivy installer.

After that ivy command is going to be available globaly.

To create a new project, just run:

```
ivy new ${project name}
```

for example ```ivy new blog```, and a new folder named "blog", which includes the application boilerplate is going to be created.
